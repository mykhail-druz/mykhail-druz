# 👋 Hey, I'm Mykhail!  
## Full-Stack Developer & Product Builder from Kyiv ⭐️

Hi there! I'm Mykhail, a Full-Stack developer who builds production-ready applications that actually survive real business growth. I specialize in **Next.js**, **React**, and **TypeScript**, crafting everything from e-commerce platforms to enterprise systems. Based in Kyiv, I'm passionate about clean architecture, scalable solutions, and bringing ideas to life. Let's build something amazing together! 🚀

### 🚀 Experience & Background

- **4+ years** Full-Stack Development
- **Frontend Lead**: Enterprise ERP system
- **Co-founder & Tech Lead**: [tech-cortex.com](https://tech-cortex.com) - E-commerce platform with real-time inventory sync across 3 distributors, handling 500+ SKUs
- **Solo developer** on multiple projects - full technical ownership from architecture to deployment
- **4700+ hours** working with clients from US, Canada, Europe, and Asia

I've launched my own e-commerce platform, so I know what it takes to ship a real product. I make architecture decisions, write production-ready code, and figure things out without hand-holding.
